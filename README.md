# Transform input data to RDF/OSLO using YARRRML mapping files

Welcome to the YARRRML-to-RDF/OSLO Transformation Repository!

This repository contains a Python notebook that transforms input data to RDF/OSLO using YARRRML mapping files. The notebook includes two main functions:

1. **transform_yarrrml_to_rml**: This function takes a YARRRML file as input, applies the necessary mappings, and generates an RML file using the [yatter library](https://github.com/oeg-upm/yatter).
2. **generate_graph**: This function takes an RML file as input, generates a named graph, and outputs the graph in N-quads format using the [morph-kgc mapping engine](https://morph-kgc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/).

The repository also includes several folders and files to support and explain the transformation process:

**input-data** 
* This folder contains the input data for the transformation process. It contains one fictional example for each entity .
* Input data can be in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or Python dictionaries. See the [morph-kgc documentation](https://morph-kgc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more info
* The data should be prepared thoroughly (cleaned, transformed, split), so that it can be used in the mapping file without further alterations.

**yarrrml-data** 
* This folder contains YARRRML mapping files for key domain entities used in the UiTwisselingsplatform. 
* These templates ensure a RDF output that is compliant with the [Flemish OSLO standards](https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/erkende-standaard/applicatieprofiel-en-vocabularium-cultuurparticipatie.html) and the [UiTwisselingsplatform Ontology](https://uitwisselingsplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDTC/pages/157548545/UiTwisselingsplatform+Ontologie+OSLO+Cultuurparticipatie)
* See the [YARRRML spec](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/) , [YARRRML tutorial](https://rml.io/yarrrml/tutorial/getting-started/) and [YARRRML playground](https://rml.io/yarrrml/matey/)

**rml-data**
* This folder contains the RML files generated by the transform_yarrrml_to_rml function.
note: morph-kgc supports yarrrml as input, but in this setup the engine is not able to generate n-quads output [BUG report](https://github.com/morph-kgc/morph-kgc/issues/202). This is why we first transform the yarrrml to rml.

**config**
* This folder contains the Morph-KGC configuration files, which specifies the output file path, output format, and mapping file path for the transformation process.
* Check the [morph-kgc documentation](https://morph-kgc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/#configuration) for a very good tutorial and more configuration options .

**output-data** 
* This folder contains the generated graph in N-quads format.
